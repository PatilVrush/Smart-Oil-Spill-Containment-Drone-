# Smart-Oil-Spill-Containment-Drone-
In this project we designed a drone and a raft system to contain huge oil spills. We use pretrained CNN model, feature matcing (SIFT and SURF) and Contour algorithms to effectively detect presence of oil. Raspberry Pi is used to control the motors of the funnel attached to the drone. Whenever there is presence of oil detected at a point, the funnel slit opens and Spill Sorb  (a bio-degradable oil absorbent), is sprayed over the oil region. Later, the semi autonomous raft flows through water and collects the oil and spill sorb mixture.
