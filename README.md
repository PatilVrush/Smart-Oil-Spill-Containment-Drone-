# Smart-Oil-Spill-Containment-Drone-
In this project we have designed a drone and a raft system to contain huge oil spills. We use pretrained CNN model, feature matching using SIFT and SURF and Contour algorithms to effectively detect presence of oil. A motorized funnel is attached to the drone. Whenever there is presence of oil detected at a point, the funnel slit opens and Spill Sorb (oil absorbent) is sprayed over the oil region. Spill Sorb is a completely bio-degradable and eco-friendly material which adsorbs oil and makes it non-flammable. Later, a semi autonomous raft flows through water and collects the oil and spill sorb mixture.
